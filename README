# Using one Heroku dyno for both web and worker

What you do is make the 'web' entry in the Procfile
run foreman which then runs a separate Procfile with
the 'real' entries. This then runs both processes
under a single dyno.

Things to be aware of:

- if using free dynos, your 'worker' will stop working when the 30 minute idle time is up

- the 'web' worker has to be the first in the secondary procfile otherwise the $PORT number gets incremented by Foreman

License is whatever you like since there's barely anything here.
